# Install Windows Mixed Reality software

## Launch Mixed Reality Portal

After you plug in your Windows Mixed Reality headset and the driver installs successfully, the Mixed Reality Portal (MRP) will automatically launch on your Desktop. If this does not happen automatically, you can always launch Mixed Reality portal from the Start menu (**Start > Mixed Reality Portal**). Once the portal has launched, click **Get Started**

In Mixed Reality Portal, you can:

* Display a livestream of the view in your headset (Windows Mixed Reality Ultra only). To turn this on and off, select "Stop preview" or "Start preview". (You can also turn preview on and off on from the mixed reality Start menu.)
* See the status of your headset and controllers. Select "Menu" to see all the info.
* Set up new controllers. Select **Menu > Set up controllers**.
* Turn the boundary on or off. Select **Menu > Boundary On / Off**. (If you turn it off, you'll need to stay in one spot for safety.)
* Create a new boundary. Select **Menu > Run setup**.
* Get to your mixed reality photos. Select **Menu > See mixed reality photos**.
* Get mixed reality apps and games. Select **Menu > Get mixed reality apps**.
