## Setup questions 

### My Xbox controller isn't working with Windows Mixed Reality.

* Make sure your controller is turned on, fully charged, and connected to the PC.
* Replace the controller’s batteries.
* If you're using a Bluetooth controller, go to **Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices** on your PC and make sure it's paired (it should be listed on the page).

### I can't direct input (controllers, gamepad, mouse/keyboard) into Windows Mixed Reality.

When you put on your headset, input should automatically get toggled to your mixed reality experience through your headset's presence sensor. A blue bar should appear on your Desktop:

If input doesn't get toggled automatically, you will need to manually toggle input to your headset. You can do this by typing **Windows Key + Y** on your keyboard (and the same to toggle input back to the desktop).

### When I plug in my headset, nothing happens. The Mixed Reality Portal doesn’t open.
Mixed Reality Portal, the app that takes you through Windows Mixed Reality setup, is designed to open automatically when you plug in a compatible headset. If it doesn’t open, go to Start and type "Mixed Reality Portal" in the Search box to open the app from there. If you can’t find Mixed Reality Portal, that might mean you need to [update to the latest version of Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq).

### How do I choose between "Seated and standing" and "All experiences"?

If you choose "Seated and standing", either during headset setup or later on, you'll be using your headset without a boundary. You can sit down or stand up, but you'll otherwise need to stay in one place, as you’ll have no boundary to help you avoid physical obstacles. Some apps might be designed to work with a boundary, so you might not be able to use them or you might not have the same experience if you use them without a boundary. See "What's a boundary and why should I create one?" below for more information.

If you choose "All experiences", you'll set up a boundary and you can use apps and experiences that work with a boundary as well as those that don't require one. 

### Learn Mixed Reality didn't run on first launch, and I went right into the Windows Mixed Reality home.

You can re-run the learning experience by following the [re-run steps](learn-mixed-reality.md#how-do-i-re-run-the-learning-experience).
