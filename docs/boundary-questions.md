# Boundary questions

## What's a boundary and why should I create one?

A boundary defines the area in which you can move around while you're wearing your Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset. Because you can't see your surroundings while you're using your headset, it's important to create a boundary to help you avoid obstacles. The boundary looks like a white outline inside mixed reality and appears when you come close to it. When you see it, slow your movements, and avoid crossing the boundary or extending your limbs beyond it.

The area inside the boundary should be free of furniture, low-hanging light fixtures, ceiling fans, etc. so you won't bump into or trip over anything.

## How do I create a boundary?

When you first set up your headset, the setup app (Mixed Reality Portal) will take you through the steps to create a boundary. But you can create one at any time. To do this:
1. Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal** on your desktop. 
2. Open "Menu".
3. Select "Run setup" to create a new boundary.

If someone else uses your headset, make sure they understand the boundary and how to use it. If you move your headset to a new location, you'll need to set up a new boundary that works for that space.

## I get an error message when I try to create a boundary.

* Don't get too close to a wall or other obstruction when creating a boundary.
* Make sure to hold your headset at waist height, and face your computer while you trace the boundary.
* Make sure the sensor isn’t blocked and there’s enough light.
* The space you’re tracing should be larger than three square meters.
* The space should not be too large or too complicated. Stick to a simple geometric shape without a lot of twists and turns.
* Don’t cross back over your own path as you’re tracing.
* If you get stuck in a corner, start over.

## During start up of Mixed Reality, I'm stuck at the step "Turn your head side to side, and then at the floor".

This step lets your headset recognize your space and restore any existing virtual floor and boundary. When you put on your headset, this scanning process can take up to 10 seconds. After it is complete, you will either be in Windows Mixed Reality home or you will be prompted to set up your boundary again.

If the scanning process takes longer than 10 seconds, there could be a problem with the proximity sensor in the headset:
1. Check that the sticker has been removed from the proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is located inside the headset roughly where the center of your forehead would be.
2. Check that your proximity sensor is toggling input to your headset: with your finger, cover and uncover the proximity sensor a few times to verify input is switching to the headset. You should see the **Windows Key + Y** banner at the top of your PC. You can manually switch input to the headset at any time by typing **Windows Key + Y** on your keyboard.

## I see a message that says my boundary can't be found. What should I do?

Windows Mixed Reality might have trouble identifying your existing boundary. You can create a new boundary or you can use your device in "Seated and standing" mode. 

## I see a message that says “Lost tracking” or “We don’t have a boundary for this space”.

You must create a new boundary. To do this:
* Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
* Select "Run setup".

## The boundary is always visible. How can I make it go away?

The boundary appears when you are close to it. If your boundary includes any sections that have a narrow or irregular shape, you might end up getting close to it, and causing it to appear, more often than you’d like. To fix this, try creating your boundary again using a larger and more regular shape. To do this:
* Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
* Select "Run setup".

## How can I turn off the boundary temporarily?

* Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
* Open "Menu". 
* Turn "Boundary" to "Off". Make sure to stay in one place while the boundary is off.
