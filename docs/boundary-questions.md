# Boundary FAQs

## What's a boundary and why should I create one?

A boundary defines the area you can move around in while wearing your Windows Mixed Reality headset. It's important to create a boundary to help you avoid the obstacles you can't see while in headset. The boundary looks like a white outline inside mixed reality and appears when you come close to it. When you see it, slow your movements, and avoid crossing the boundary or extending your limbs beyond it.

The area inside the boundary should be free of furniture, low-hanging light fixtures, ceiling fans, etc. so you won't bump into or trip over anything. [Learn about health and safety in Windows Mixed Reality](HMD-health-safety-comfort.md).

## How do I create a boundary?

When you first set up your headset, the setup app (Mixed Reality Portal) will take you through the steps to create a boundary. But you to create one at any time:
1. Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal** on your desktop. 
2. Open "Menu".
3. Select "Setup up room boundary" to create a new boundary.

If someone else uses your headset, make sure they understand the boundary and how to use it. If you move your headset to a new location, you'll need to set up a new boundary that works for that space.

## I get an error message when I try to create a boundary.

* Don't get too close to a wall or other obstruction when creating a boundary.
* Make sure to hold your headset at waist height, and face your computer while you trace the boundary.
* Make sure the sensor isn’t blocked and there’s enough light.
* The space you’re tracing should be larger than three square meters.
* The space should not be too large or too complicated. Stick to a simple geometric shape without a lot of twists and turns.
* Don’t cross back over your own path as you’re tracing.
* If you get stuck in a corner, start over.

## The system cannot find the boundary and I'm being presented with setup UI.

This means that the tracking system was unable to recognize your environment. If you are in a new environment, you must set up the [boundary](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/set-up-windows-mixed-reality#set-up-your-room-boundary). If you have previously used the device in this environment and set up a boundary:
* Make sure the room has enough light.
* Make sure you have worn the device and looked around the room. The device must observe your environment to know where it is. It will not find your bounds if it is sitting on a desk or table.
* Unplug the device, close Windows Mixed Reality, and plug it in again.
* If something in the environment has changed, the device may no longer recognize it. Set up a new boundary.

If these steps do not resolve the problem, delete your environment data and set up the boundary again.

## The system is presenting me with UI that asks me to choose setup for all experiences or seated/standing, and I see my bounds.

The device is taking too long to find the bounds. You can bypass this message by choosing the option to use a boundary and you will be taken to your Windows Mixed Reality home with your bounds present.

## I often see a message saying "I've lost my bounds".

The tracking system is having a hard time tracking and identifying your environment. In this state, the device can no longer display your bounds and the headset switches to 3DOF to keep you from to bumping into things in the real world until it locates your bounds again. To fix this:
1. Make sure that the room has enough light.
2. Rerun the setup if you recently redecorated or remodeled the room.
3. Unplug the device, close Windows Mixed Reality, and plug it in again.
4. Clear your environment data and set up the device again.
5. If the message persists, contact customer support.

## A message says my boundary can't be found. What should I do?

Windows Mixed Reality might have trouble identifying your existing boundary. You can create a new boundary or you can use your device in "Seated and standing" mode. 

## A message says “Lost tracking” or “We don’t have a boundary for this space”.

You must create a new boundary. To do this:
1. Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
2. Open "Menu".
3. Select "Setup up room boundary".

## The boundary is always visible. How can I make it go away?

The boundary appears when you are close to it. If your boundary includes any sections that have a narrow or irregular shape, you might end up getting close to it, and causing it to appear, more often than you’d like. To fix this, try creating your boundary again using a larger and more regular shape. To do this:
1. Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
2. Open "Menu".
3. Select "Setup up room boundary".

## Can I turn off the boundary temporarily?

* Select **Start > Mixed Reality Portal**.
* Open "Menu". 
* Turn "Boundary" to "Off". Make sure to stay in one place while the boundary is off.
